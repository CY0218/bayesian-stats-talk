# talk features

## minimal terminology

let's focus on the mechanics of analysis, rather than the terminology

## pareto principle

the basics will get you to 80% of what you'll need

# not covered

"Stuff I am not sufficiently trained in to speak intelligently about."

- Bayesian nets
- Bayesian deep learning & machine learning

# statistical analysis problems

## parameter estimation

## comparison between experimental groups


## biased coin problem

## cookie jar problem

# probabilistic programming

## pymc3
